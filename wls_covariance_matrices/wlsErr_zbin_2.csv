# It's a pandas dataFrame file.
# 
# Columns are in the format - z{x}_stelM_thresh_{y} 
# where 
# 	x: "redshift bin" taking values of either 1 for [0.30,0.55] bin or 2 for [0.55,0.80] bin.
# 	y: "log of stellar mass threshod in units of h^{-2} Msun" taking values between 8.6-11.2
# Each column represents a threshold sample
# The number of rows correspond to the 10 radial bins, top to bottom correspond to smallest-largest radial bin.
