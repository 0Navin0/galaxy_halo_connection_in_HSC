#Uderstanding the columns of the files in this directory

columns 5,6,7,8,14 => ESD, Sumwls_by_sumwl, radii, ESD_cross, r2bias

  >> Steps to get modellable signals around lenses:
  1) r2 bias correction was done first done on ESD signals.
  2) subtract the same from that around random points ==> this is placed in another directory "WLS_randoms_threshold_bins"
  3) boost the signal after step 2
  This is the signal that we modeled in the paepr.

  >> Steps to get cross signals around lenses:
  ESD_cross * boost factor

  >> boost factor = Sumwls_by_sumwl from lenses / Sumwls_by_sumwl from randoms
